# Welcome to a two-player game TicTacToe!

### How to play:
* Open index.html in your browser
* After writing down names for both players, the first player is asked to make his move
* Box will show the move you made and will await the next player's turn.
* Continue playing untill someone wins or results in a draw. Good luck!
